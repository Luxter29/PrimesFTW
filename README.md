Prime numbers are the best, but I need to find 'em all.

  
  *Problem Request*

You are given an array of -N- positive integers. 
I want to know how many prime numbers are there between 0 and each number of the array, 
discarding those which are divisors of the number.
The output is the TOTAL sum.

  *Inputs*

The first number -T- denotes the number of test cases. 
The next one is the amount of numbers the array holds in.
The next line contains the numbers of the array.

  *Example*
  
INPUT:

2

3

5 8 9

2

4 11

OUTPUT:

8
